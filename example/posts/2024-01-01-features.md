# Features

Medusa is a minimal Python static site generator designed for simplicity. Here's what makes it great.

## Zero Configuration

Start building immediately with sensible defaults. No config files required to get started.

## Zero Frontmatter

Unlike other generators, Medusa derives metadata automatically:

- **Title** comes from the first `# heading` in your content
- **Date** is extracted from the filename (e.g., `2024-01-15-my-post.md`)
- **Tags** are pulled from `#hashtags` in your content
- **Description** is generated from the first paragraph

## Markdown + Jinja2

Write content in Markdown with full support for:

- Tables
- Footnotes
- Strikethrough
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Auto-linked URLs

Use Jinja2 for layouts and dynamic pages with access to all your content.

## Tailwind CSS Built-in

Tailwind CSS is processed automatically when you run a build. Just write your classes and go.

## Live Reload

The dev server watches your files and reloads the browser automatically when you save changes.

## Pretty URLs

Pages are output as directories with `index.html` files:

- `site/about.md` becomes `/about/`
- `site/posts/hello.md` becomes `/posts/hello/`

## Automatic Sitemap and RSS

When you configure a site URL, Medusa generates `sitemap.xml` and `rss.xml` automatically.

## Drafts

Mark files as drafts by prefixing with `_` (e.g., `_work-in-progress.md`). They're excluded from builds unless you use the `--drafts` flag.

## YAML Frontmatter

Optional YAML frontmatter for custom data:

```markdown
---
author: Jane Doe
featured: true
---

# My Post
```

Access it in templates with `{{ frontmatter.author }}`.
