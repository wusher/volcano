# Installation

Getting Medusa set up is quick and easy.

## Requirements

Before installing, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **Node.js 16+** (for Tailwind CSS processing)

## Install from PyPI

The easiest way to install Medusa:

```bash
pip install medusa-ssg
```

## Install from Source

For development or to get the latest changes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/medusa.git
cd medusa
pip install -e .
```

## Install Tailwind CSS

Medusa uses the Tailwind CLI to process CSS. Install it globally or per-project:

```bash
# Global install
npm install -g tailwindcss

# Or per-project (recommended)
npm install -D tailwindcss
```

When you create a new project with `medusa new`, it includes a `package.json` with Tailwind as a dependency.

## Optional Dependencies

For image optimization, install Pillow:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

For JavaScript minification, you can use either:

```bash
# Python library
pip install rjsmin

# Or Node.js tool
npm install -D terser
```

## Verify Installation

Check that Medusa is installed correctly:

```bash
medusa --version
```
