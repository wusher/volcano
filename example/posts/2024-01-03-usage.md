# CLI Commands

Medusa provides a simple command-line interface for managing your site.

## Create a New Project

Scaffold a new Medusa project with all the starter files:

```bash
medusa new mysite
cd mysite
```

This creates a directory with layouts, sample posts, and configuration files.

## Build Your Site

Compile your site to static HTML in the `output/` directory:

```bash
medusa build
```

### Include Drafts

To build with draft content included:

```bash
medusa build --drafts
```

## Run the Dev Server

Start a local server with live reload:

```bash
medusa serve
```

Your site will be available at http://localhost:4000

### Server Options

Customize the server with these flags:

```bash
# Custom HTTP port
medusa serve --port 3000

# Custom WebSocket port for live reload
medusa serve --ws-port 3001

# Include drafts while developing
medusa serve --drafts
```

## Create New Content

Interactively create a new markdown file:

```bash
medusa md
```

This prompts you to:

1. Select a folder (posts, pages, or root)
2. Enter a filename
3. Optionally add a date prefix

## Show Help

Get help on any command:

```bash
medusa --help
medusa build --help
medusa serve --help
```
