# Content Writing Tips

Helpful notes for writing content in Medusa.

## Draft Content

Mark files as drafts in two ways:

1. **Prefix with underscore**: `_work-in-progress.md`
2. **Prefix folder with underscore**: `_experiments/test.md`

Drafts are excluded from builds unless you use `--drafts`:

```bash
medusa build --drafts
medusa serve --drafts
```

## Date Prefixes

Add a date to your filename for automatic date extraction:

```
2024-01-15-my-post.md
```

The date is stripped from the URL:
- Filename: `2024-01-15-my-post.md`
- URL: `/posts/my-post/`
- Date: January 15, 2024

## Hashtag Tags

Add tags anywhere in your content using hashtags:

```markdown
This post is about #python and #web development.
```

Tags must be:
- At least 3 characters
- Alphanumeric (can include slashes for nesting)

The hashtags are removed from the rendered output.

## Images in Markdown

Reference images with relative paths:

```markdown
![My Image](my-image.png)
```

Medusa rewrites this to `/assets/images/my-image.png` in the output.

Place your images in the `assets/images/` directory.

## Number Prefixes for Ordering

Order pages manually with number prefixes:

```
site/docs/01-introduction.md
site/docs/02-getting-started.md
site/docs/03-advanced.md
```

The numbers are stripped from URLs but control sort order within pages that share the same date.

## Code Syntax Highlighting

Use fenced code blocks with a language identifier:

~~~markdown
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
~~~

Include Pygments CSS in your layout:

```jinja
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ css_path('pygments') }}">
```

Or generate it inline:

```jinja
<style>{{ pygments_css() }}</style>
```

## Frontmatter

Add optional YAML frontmatter for custom data:

```markdown
---
author: Jane Doe
category: tutorials
featured: true
---

# My Post Title

Content goes here.
```

Access in templates:

```jinja
{% if frontmatter.featured %}
  <span>Featured Post</span>
{% endif %}
```

## Supported Markdown Features
